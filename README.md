1. The task involves migrating data from an existing source table (`customers`) to a newly created destination table (`destination_table`).
2. The `destination_table` is structured with columns such as `cust_id`, `name`, `age`, `gender`, `city`, `state`, and `memb_type`.
3. The migration query uses an `INSERT INTO` statement to copy data from `customers` into the `destination_table`.
4. Both tables (`customers` and `destination_table`) are examined using `SELECT` statements to verify data before and after migration.
5. The goal is to ensure seamless data transfer and validation between the source and destination tables.
